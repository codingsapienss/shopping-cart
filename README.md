# shopping-cart
live-demo : https://codingsapienss.github.io/shopping-cart/


This is a fully functional shopping cart project made with the help of vanilla javascript.
You can select how many items you want to add to cart and on cart section you can check all your selected items with the price of each and total items.
You can also delete/remove the items from cart option.

I have used localstorage so even if you refresh the web page your selected items will still be there.

To know more your can check the link and I hope you will like the project.
I am open to any suggestion/improvements.
